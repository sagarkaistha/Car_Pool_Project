# Carr POOLING Just got a little fun ?

Welcome to Car pool, where seamless travel experiences begin!

## Overview

Our platform prioritizes user security and convenience, starting with a secure authentication process. First-time users can easily establish their presence within the system through a user-friendly login or registration process. Once authenticated or registered, users are presented with a pivotal choice: either search for available rides or register their own.

## Registering a Ride

If you choose to register a ride, our system guides you through the process of inputting essential details, including the date, time, location, and the number of passengers. This information contributes to the creation of a registered pool, ensuring a comprehensive and organized record of available rides.

## Searching for a Ride

Users also have the option to search for rides. By inputting specific details such as date, time, and the number of passengers, the system provides a curated list of available rides. This streamlined process allows users to easily identify and select the ride that best suits their needs.

## Connecting with Ease

Once a user has chosen a ride, the primary user (the person who registered the ride) has the opportunity to initiate a chat with the person requesting the ride. This direct communication channel facilitates coordination and ensures that both parties are aligned in their travel plans.

## Confirming the Ride

Upon mutual agreement, users can confirm the ride, moving it from the requested status to the confirmed/booked rides section. This ensures a seamless transition from the planning phase to the confirmed travel arrangement.
